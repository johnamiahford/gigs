# Charlotte Gigs on Geddy
[Geddy](http://geddyjs.org) is a simple, structured web framework for Node.

  First install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) to your machine. You can use the installer
  found on their website if you like. For a much more advance approach, use node version
  manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install multiple nodejs builds.
  
  Geddy can be installed with npm. Npm comes standard with your download of
  node. Run...
  
  `npm install -g geddy jake`
  
  Jake is a dependency for Geddy and will need to be installed.
  
  A generated app can now be created by changing to your desired directory and
  running... 

  `geddy app name_of_your_app`

  Now get to work!
